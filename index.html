    <p>
      This is a Algorithmic trading backtester for lightning quick trading sometimes referred to as 
      "<em>Day Trading</em>" or (more specifically) "<em>Scalping</em>". 
      
      <br>
      <br>
      This brand of investing involves very short 
      trade periods, sometimes minutes, sometimes seconds. This is a huge departure from more typical investing which 
      has a time-horizon of several months to many years. In short term trading, the stocks traded are 
      riskier and are experiencing a period of abnormal volatility. 
      
      <br><br>
      The basic precept behind daytrading ideology is that 
      there is inefficency in extremely volatile stocks. The time period that has volatility is evidence of this inefficiency
      and allows a short window to capitalize on the higher percentage swings.
      
      <br><br>
      This project works with CSV files with the open, high, low and close prices (OHLC) for each minute during normal 
      market hours (9:30AM - 4PM EST). I have created an algorithm that will create what is known as <em>tick</em> data 
      for each one of these minutes. The source code for interpolating second data is in the 
      <div class="path">local_functions/data_management/historical_funcs.py</div> 
      in the function called "<em>create_second_data</em>"

    <h2>File Structure Overview</h2>
    <h3>Root Level</h3>
    <div class="file">
      <p><span class="path">index.html</span>: This page!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="file">
      <p><span class="path">main.py</span>: from here batch testing can be commenced as well as batch 
        comparisons and various other functions. While batch testing 
        does have command line interface, I often edit this file for more exact control.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="file">
      <p><span class="path">test.py</span>: A file for sandbox testing of functionality of new features. 
        Nothing pivotal happens here.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="file">
      <p><span class="path">update_form.py</span>: When run will update the <span class="path">config_form.html</span> based on the new values
        in the <span class="path">local_functions/main/config.json</span> and the adjacent <span class="path">config_descriptions.json</span>. 
        If you would like more info on this process, you can visit the documentation I did for this form generation 
        <a href="https://dcorso21.github.io/PythonFormsFromJSON/" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="file">
      <p><span class="path">batches.html</span>: This file is updated with each batch test and serves as a directory for 
        all of the previous results of the batches. Here is the <a href="batches.html" target="_blank">current batches.html</a>.
      </p>

    <h3>Batch Design</h3>
    <p>This directory holds the templates and the assets (CSS, JS, Fonts) for the 
      <div id="results-files">results pages</div> 
      These assets are both used when visiting the results pages, and also used for creating them.
      
      
    </p>
    <h3>Config</h3>
    <p>
      This folder stores all of the saved configurations for batch tests and also the templates for creating 
      new forms to create the configurations. I know that this seems odd. If you are interested in seeing how this 
      is done, please check out my documentation of the process <a href="https://dcorso21.github.io/PythonFormsFromJSON/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Documentation Assets</h3>
    <p>The documentation is what you are reading right now. Inside this folder is the assets seen in these docs.</p>
    <h3>Local Functions</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>mkt_csvs</h3>
    <p>
      The csv data of market prices (OHLC) each minute that the market is open. It is important 
      to populate this folder because the batch testing uses this data to trade.
    </p>
    <h3 id="results-files">Results</h3>
    <p>
      This is where the results of the batch tests and batch comparisons are kept. They are categorized by date 
      and time and can be accessed with great detail through the <span class="path">batches.html</span> file. You can visit 
      the active link <a href="batches.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Temp_Assets</h3>
    <p>
      This folder is exclusively used for singular tests on one stock at a time (ei: without batch testing.) In previous versions, 
      each stock's results would be saved here in the batch test but the practice was deprecated to avoid issues with running multiple batch tests at once.
      The use of a singular non-batch test is still functional, but not suggested. See <a href="#batch-of-one">batch of one instead</a>.
